# 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è The One Billion Row Challenge

A [C++ implementation](./main.cpp) of the orignal java challenge here: https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc

Discussion thread here: https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/discussions/495

Perfoms fractionally better (at time of writing) than another C++ solution here: https://github.com/lehuyduc/1brc-simd.

I didn't look at any solutions while developing, as a result there's tricks missed, and maybe more performance to be gained.
lehuyduc's code seems to leverge some ILP tricks that I haven't got. Maybe others around reordering etc.
Probably the largest performance gain comes from leverage avx512 simd instructions, which lehuyduc's solution could be easily adapted to take advantage of.

Comparison benchmark results against last and current generation aws intel and amd machines: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GkPeLJ-a4vFGoZU53JodoyP1pqLE0cLtRjEdMjZR_dc/edit?usp=sharing

## Example usage.

```
clang++-16 -O3 -std=c++20 -march=native -pthread main.cpp
THREADS=8 ./a.out
```
